# Subagents

> Create and use specialized AI subagents in Claude Code for task-specific workflows and improved context management.

Custom subagents in Claude Code are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked to handle specific types of tasks. They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools and a separate context window.

## What are subagents?

Subagents are pre-configured AI personalities that Claude Code can delegate tasks to. Each subagent:

- Has a specific purpose and expertise area
- Uses its own context window separate from the main conversation
- Can be configured with specific tools it's allowed to use
- Includes a custom system prompt that guides its behavior

When Claude Code encounters a task that matches a subagent's expertise, it can delegate that task to the specialized subagent, which works independently and returns results.

## Key benefits

## Quick start

To create your first subagent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the subagents interface">
    Run the following command:

    ```
    /agents
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'Create New Agent'">
    Choose whether to create a project-level or user-level subagent
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define the subagent">
    * **Recommended**: Generate with Claude first, then customize to make it yours
    * Describe your subagent in detail and when it should be used
    * Select the tools you want to grant access to (or leave blank to inherit all tools)
    * The interface shows all available tools, making selection easy
    * If you're generating with Claude, you can also edit the system prompt in your own editor by pressing `e`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and use">
    Your subagent is now available! Claude will use it automatically when appropriate, or you can invoke it explicitly:

    ```
    > Use the code-reviewer subagent to check my recent changes
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Subagent configuration

### File locations

Subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in two possible locations:

| Type                  | Location            | Scope                         | Priority |
| :-------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :------- |
| **Project subagents** | `.claude/agents/`   | Available in current project  | Highest  |
| **User subagents**    | `~/.claude/agents/` | Available across all projects | Lower    |

When subagent names conflict, project-level subagents take precedence over user-level subagents.

### File format

Each subagent is defined in a Markdown file with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the subagent should follow.
```

#### Configuration fields

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                 |
| :------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`        | Yes      | Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens                                       |
| `description` | Yes      | Natural language description of the subagent's purpose                                      |
| `tools`       | No       | Comma-separated list of specific tools. If omitted, inherits all tools from the main thread |

### Available tools

Subagents can be granted access to any of Claude Code's internal tools. See the [tools documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#tools-available-to-claude) for a complete list of available tools.

<Tip>
  **Recommended:** Use the `/agents` command to modify tool access - it provides an interactive interface that lists all available tools, including any connected MCP server tools, making it easier to select the ones you need.
</Tip>

You have two options for configuring tools:

- **Omit the `tools` field** to inherit all tools from the main thread (default), including MCP tools
- **Specify individual tools** as a comma-separated list for more granular control (can be edited manually or via `/agents`)

**MCP Tools**: Subagents can access MCP tools from configured MCP servers. When the `tools` field is omitted, subagents inherit all MCP tools available to the main thread.

## Managing subagents

### Using the /agents command (Recommended)

The `/agents` command provides a comprehensive interface for subagent management:

```
/agents
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can:

- View all available subagents (built-in, user, and project)
- Create new subagents with guided setup
- Edit existing custom subagents, including their tool access
- Delete custom subagents
- See which subagents are active when duplicates exist
- **Easily manage tool permissions** with a complete list of available tools

### Direct file management

You can also manage subagents by working directly with their files:

```bash
# Create a project subagent
mkdir -p .claude/agents
echo '---
name: test-runner
description: Use proactively to run tests and fix failures
---

You are a test automation expert. When you see code changes, proactively run the appropriate tests. If tests fail, analyze the failures and fix them while preserving the original test intent.' > .claude/agents/test-runner.md

# Create a user subagent
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
# ... create subagent file
```

## Using subagents effectively

### Automatic delegation

Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on:

- The task description in your request
- The `description` field in subagent configurations
- Current context and available tools

<Tip>
  To encourage more proactive subagent use, include phrases like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" in your `description` field.
</Tip>

### Explicit invocation

Request a specific subagent by mentioning it in your command:

```
> Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
> Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
> Ask the debugger subagent to investigate this error
```

## Example subagents

### Code reviewer

For each analysis:

- Explain the query approach
- Document any assumptions
- Highlight key findings
- Suggest next steps based on data

Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.
```

## Best practices

- **Start with Claude-generated agents**: We highly recommend generating your initial subagent with Claude and then iterating on it to make it personally yours. This approach gives you the best results - a solid foundation that you can customize to your specific needs.

- **Design focused subagents**: Create subagents with single, clear responsibilities rather than trying to make one subagent do everything. This improves performance and makes subagents more predictable.

- **Write detailed prompts**: Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints in your system prompts. The more guidance you provide, the better the subagent will perform.

- **Limit tool access**: Only grant tools that are necessary for the subagent's purpose. This improves security and helps the subagent focus on relevant actions.

- **Version control**: Check project subagents into version control so your team can benefit from and improve them collaboratively.

## Advanced usage

### Chaining subagents

For complex workflows, you can chain multiple subagents:

```
> First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
```

### Dynamic subagent selection

Claude Code intelligently selects subagents based on context. Make your `description` fields specific and action-oriented for best results.

## Performance considerations

- **Context efficiency**: Agents help preserve main context, enabling longer overall sessions
- **Latency**: Subagents start off with a clean slate each time they are invoked and may add latency as they gather context that they require to do their job effectively.

# Get started with Claude Code hooks

> Learn how to customize and extend Claude Code's behavior by registering shell commands

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
in Claude Code's lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
the LLM to choose to run them.

<Tip>
  For reference documentation on hooks, see [Hooks reference](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).
</Tip>

Example use cases for hooks include:

- **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
  your input or permission to run something.
- **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
  etc. after every file edit.
- **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
  debugging.
- **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
  does not follow your codebase conventions.
- **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
  directories.

By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

<Warning>
  You must consider the security implication of hooks as you add them, because hooks run automatically during the agent loop with your current environment's credentials.
  For example, malicious hooks code can exfiltrate your data. Always review your hooks implementation before registering them.

For full security best practices, see [Security Considerations](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks#security-considerations) in the hooks reference documentation.
</Warning>

## Hook Events Overview

Claude Code provides several hook events that run at different points in the
workflow:

- **PreToolUse**: Runs before tool calls (can block them)
- **PostToolUse**: Runs after tool calls complete
- **Notification**: Runs when Claude Code sends notifications
- **Stop**: Runs when Claude Code finishes responding
- **Subagent Stop**: Runs when subagent tasks complete

Each event receives different data and can control Claude's behavior in
different ways.

## Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
Code runs.

### Prerequisites

Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

### Step 1: Open hooks configuration

Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) and select
the `PreToolUse` hook event.

`PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
Claude feedback on what to do differently.

### Step 2: Add a matcher

Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.

Type `Bash` for the matcher.

<Note>You can use `*` to match all tools.</Note>

### Step 3: Add the hook

Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

```bash
jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

### Step 4: Save your configuration

For storage location, select `User settings` since you're logging to your home
directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
project.

Then press Esc until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered!

### Step 5: Verify your hook

Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Test your hook

Ask Claude to run a simple command like `ls` and check your log file:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

You should see entries like:

```
ls - Lists files and directories
```

## More Examples

<Note>
  For a complete example implementation, see the [bash command validator example](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/examples/hooks/bash_command_validator_example.py) in our public codebase.
</Note>

### Code Formatting Hook

Automatically format TypeScript files after editing:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | { read file_path; if echo \"$file_path\" | grep -q '\\.ts$'; then npx prettier --write \"$file_path\"; fi; }"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Custom Notification Hook

Get desktop notifications when Claude needs input:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Awaiting your input'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### File Protection Hook

Block edits to sensitive files:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import json, sys; data=json.load(sys.stdin); path=data.get('tool_input',{}).get('file_path',''); sys.exit(2 if any(p in path for p in ['.env', 'package-lock.json', '.git/']) else 0)\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

[View repository →](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-base-action)

## Setup

## Quick setup

The easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

<Note>
  * You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
  * This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. If you're using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, please see the [Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock-%26-google-vertex-ai) section.
</Note>

## Manual setup

If the `/install-github-app` command fails or you prefer manual setup, please follow these manual setup instructions:

1. **Install the Claude GitHub app** to your repository: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)
2. **Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))
3. **Copy the workflow file** from [examples/claude.yml](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/examples/claude.yml) into your repository's `.github/workflows/`

<Tip>
  After completing either the quickstart or manual setup, test the action by tagging `@claude` in an issue or PR comment!
</Tip>

## Example use cases

Claude Code GitHub Actions can help you with a variety of tasks. For complete working examples, see the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples).

### Turn issues into PRs

In an issue comment:

```
@claude implement this feature based on the issue description
```

Claude will analyze the issue, write the code, and create a PR for review.

In a PR comment:

```
@claude how should I implement user authentication for this endpoint?
```

Claude will analyze your code and provide specific implementation guidance.

### Fix bugs quickly

In an issue:

```yaml
@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component
```

Claude will locate the bug, implement a fix, and create a PR.

## Best practices

### CLAUDE.md configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude's understanding of your project standards.

### Security considerations

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys directly to your repository!
</Warning>

Always use GitHub Secrets for API keys:

- Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Reference it in workflows: `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
- Limit action permissions to only what's necessary
- Review Claude's suggestions before merging

Always use GitHub Secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.

### Optimizing performance

Use issue templates to provide context, keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.

### CI costs

When using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs:

**GitHub Actions costs:**

- Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes
- See [GitHub's billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for detailed pricing and minute limits

**API costs:**

- Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses
- Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
- See [Claude's pricing page](https://www.anthropic.com/api) for current token rates

**Cost optimization tips:**

- Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Configure appropriate `max_turns` limits to prevent excessive iterations
- Set reasonable `timeout_minutes` to avoid runaway workflows
- Consider using GitHub's concurrency controls to limit parallel runs

## Configuration examples

For ready-to-use workflow configurations for different use cases, including:

- Basic workflow setup for issue and PR comments
- Automated code reviews on pull requests
- Custom implementations for specific needs

Visit the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) in the Claude Code Action repository.

<Tip>
  The examples repository includes complete, tested workflows that you can copy directly into your `.github/workflows/` directory.
</Tip>

## Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI

For enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:

#### For Google Cloud Vertex AI:

1. A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
2. Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions
3. A service account with the required permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

#### For AWS Bedrock:

1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled
2. GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS
3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom GitHub App (Recommended for 3P Providers)">
    For best control and security when using 3P providers like Vertex AI or Bedrock, we recommend creating your own GitHub App:

    1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)
    2. Fill in the basic information:
       * **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name (e.g., "YourOrg Claude Assistant")
       * **Homepage URL**: Your organization's website or the repository URL
    3. Configure the app settings:
       * **Webhooks**: Uncheck "Active" (not needed for this integration)
    4. Set the required permissions:
       * **Repository permissions**:
         * Contents: Read & Write
         * Issues: Read & Write
         * Pull requests: Read & Write
    5. Click "Create GitHub App"
    6. After creation, click "Generate a private key" and save the downloaded `.pem` file
    7. Note your App ID from the app settings page
    8. Install the app to your repository:
       * From your app's settings page, click "Install App" in the left sidebar
       * Select your account or organization
       * Choose "Only select repositories" and select the specific repository
       * Click "Install"
    9. Add the private key as a secret to your repository:
       * Go to your repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
       * Create a new secret named `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with the contents of the `.pem` file
    10. Add the App ID as a secret:

    * Create a new secret named `APP_ID` with your GitHub App's ID

    <Note>
      This app will be used with the [actions/create-github-app-token](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) action to generate authentication tokens in your workflows.
    </Note>

    **Alternative for Anthropic API or if you don't want to setup your own Github app**: Use the official Anthropic app:

    1. Install from: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)
    2. No additional configuration needed for authentication

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure cloud provider authentication">
    Choose your cloud provider and set up secure authentication:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="AWS Bedrock">
        **Configure AWS to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**

        > **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

        **Required Setup**:

        1. **Enable Amazon Bedrock**:
           * Request access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock
           * For cross-region models, request access in all required regions

        2. **Set up GitHub OIDC Identity Provider**:
           * Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
           * Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`

        3. **Create IAM Role for GitHub Actions**:
           * Trusted entity type: Web identity
           * Identity provider: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
           * Permissions: `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy
           * Configure trust policy for your specific repository

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **AWS\_ROLE\_TO\_ASSUME**: The ARN of the IAM role you created

        <Tip>
          OIDC is more secure than using static AWS access keys because credentials are temporary and automatically rotated.
        </Tip>

        See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for detailed OIDC setup instructions.

           * Security Token Service (STS) API
           * Vertex AI API

        2. **Create Workload Identity Federation resources**:
           * Create a Workload Identity Pool
           * Add a GitHub OIDC provider with:
             * Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
             * Attribute mappings for repository and owner
             * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific attribute conditions

        3. **Create a Service Account**:
           * Grant only `Vertex AI User` role
           * **Security recommendation**: Create a dedicated service account per repository

        4. **Configure IAM bindings**:
           * Allow the Workload Identity Pool to impersonate the service account
           * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific principal sets

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **GCP\_WORKLOAD\_IDENTITY\_PROVIDER**: The full provider resource name
        * **GCP\_SERVICE\_ACCOUNT**: The service account email address

        <Tip>
          Workload Identity Federation eliminates the need for downloadable service account keys, improving security.
        </Tip>

        For detailed setup instructions, consult the [Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).

## Troubleshooting

### Claude not responding to @claude commands

Verify the GitHub App is installed correctly, check that workflows are enabled, ensure API key is set in repository secrets, and confirm the comment contains `@claude` (not `/claude`).

### CI not running on Claude's commits

Ensure you're using the GitHub App or custom app (not Actions user), check workflow triggers include the necessary events, and verify app permissions include CI triggers.

### Authentication errors

Confirm API key is valid and has sufficient permissions. For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.

## Advanced configuration

### Action parameters

The Claude Code Action supports these key parameters:

| Parameter           | Description                    | Required |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `prompt`            | The prompt to send to Claude   | Yes\*    |
| `prompt_file`       | Path to file containing prompt | Yes\*    |
| `anthropic_api_key` | Anthropic API key              | Yes\*\*  |
| `max_turns`         | Maximum conversation turns     | No       |
| `timeout_minutes`   | Execution timeout              | No       |

\*Either `prompt` or `prompt_file` required\
\*\*Required for direct Anthropic API, not for Bedrock/Vertex

### Alternative integration methods

While the `/install-github-app` command is the recommended approach, you can also:

- **Custom GitHub App**: For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.
- **Manual GitHub Actions**: Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility
- **MCP Configuration**: Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers

See the [Claude Code Action repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) for detailed documentation.

### Customizing Claude's behavior

You can configure Claude's behavior in two ways:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our [Memory documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/memory) for more details.
2. **Custom prompts**: Use the `prompt` parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude's behavior for different workflows or tasks.

Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.

Claude Code can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), an open-source standard for AI-tool integrations. MCP servers give Claude Code access to your tools, databases, and APIs.

## What you can do with MCP

With MCP servers connected, you can ask Claude Code to:

- **Implement features from issue trackers**: "Add the feature described in JIRA issue ENG-4521 and create a PR on GitHub."
- **Analyze monitoring data**: "Check Sentry and Statsig to check the usage of the feature described in ENG-4521."
- **Query databases**: "Find emails of 10 random users who used feature ENG-4521, based on our Postgres database."
- **Integrate designs**: "Update our standard email template based on the new Figma designs that were posted in Slack"
- **Automate workflows**: "Create Gmail drafts inviting these 10 users to a feedback session about the new feature."

## Popular MCP servers

Here are some commonly used MCP servers you can connect to Claude Code:

<Warning>
  Use third party MCP servers at your own risk - Anthropic has not verified
  the correctness or security of all these servers.
  Make sure you trust MCP servers you are installing.
  Be especially careful when using MCP servers that could fetch untrusted
  content, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.
</Warning>

<MCPServersTable platform="claudeCode" />

<Note>
  **Need a specific integration?** [Find hundreds more MCP servers on GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), or build your own using the [MCP SDK](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).
</Note>

## Installing MCP servers

MCP servers can be configured in three different ways depending on your needs:

### Option 1: Add a local stdio server

Stdio servers run as local processes on your machine. They're ideal for tools that need direct system access or custom scripts.

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]

# Real example: Add Airtable server
claude mcp add airtable --env AIRTABLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  -- npx -y airtable-mcp-server
```

### Option 2: Add a remote SSE server

SSE (Server-Sent Events) servers provide real-time streaming connections. Many cloud services use this for live updates.

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Linear
claude mcp add --transport sse linear https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Example with authentication header
claude mcp add --transport sse private-api https://api.company.com/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-key-here"
```

### Option 3: Add a remote HTTP server

HTTP servers use standard request/response patterns. Most REST APIs and web services use this transport.

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Notion
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp

# Example with Bearer token
claude mcp add --transport http secure-api https://api.example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### Managing your servers

Once configured, you can manage your MCP servers with these commands:

```bash
# List all configured servers
claude mcp list

# Get details for a specific server
claude mcp get github

# Remove a server
claude mcp remove github

# (within Claude Code) Check server status
/mcp
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use the `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
  - `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called `project` in older versions)
  - `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via `.mcp.json` file
  - `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called `global` in older versions)
- Set environment variables with `--env` flags (e.g., `--env KEY=value`)
- Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP_TIMEOUT environment variable (e.g., `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
- Use `/mcp` to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication
  </Tip>

<Warning>
  **Windows Users**: On native Windows (not WSL), local MCP servers that use `npx` require the `cmd /c` wrapper to ensure proper execution.

```bash
# This creates command="cmd" which Windows can execute
claude mcp add my-server -- cmd /c npx -y @some/package
```

Without the `cmd /c` wrapper, you'll encounter "Connection closed" errors because Windows cannot directly execute `npx`.
</Warning>

## MCP installation scopes

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in your project-specific user settings. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn't be shared.

```bash
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add my-private-server /path/to/server

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add my-private-server --scope local /path/to/server
```

### Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project's root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

```bash
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add shared-server --scope project /path/to/server
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### User scope

User-scoped servers provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

```bash
# Add a user server
claude mcp add my-user-server --scope user /path/to/server
```

### Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

- **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
- **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
- **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently-used services

### Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### Environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json`

Claude Code supports environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json` files, allowing teams to share configurations while maintaining flexibility for machine-specific paths and sensitive values like API keys.

**Supported syntax:**

- `${VAR}` - Expands to the value of environment variable `VAR`
- `${VAR:-default}` - Expands to `VAR` if set, otherwise uses `default`

**Expansion locations:**
Environment variables can be expanded in:

- `command` - The server executable path
- `args` - Command-line arguments
- `env` - Environment variables passed to the server
- `url` - For SSE/HTTP server types
- `headers` - For SSE/HTTP server authentication

**Example with variable expansion:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-server": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "${API_BASE_URL:-https://api.example.com}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If a required environment variable is not set and has no default value, Claude Code will fail to parse the config.

## Practical examples

{/_ These are commented out while waiting for approval in https://anthropic.slack.com/archives/C08R8A6SZEX/p1754320373845919. I'm expecting/hoping to get this approval soon, so keeping this here for easy uncommenting. Reviewer: feel free to just delete this if you'd prefer. _/}

{/\* ### Example: Connect to GitHub for code reviews

```bash
# 1. Add the GitHub MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/

# 2. In Claude Code, authenticate if needed
> /mcp
# Select "Authenticate" for GitHub

# 3. Now you can ask Claude to work with GitHub
> "Review PR #456 and suggest improvements"
> "Create a new issue for the bug we just found"
> "Show me all open PRs assigned to me"
```

  <Tip>
  Tips:
  - Also see the [GitHub Actions](/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions) integration to run this automatically. 
  - If you have the GitHub CLI installed, you might prefer using it directly with Claude Code's bash tool instead of the MCP server for some operations.
  </Tip>

### Example: Query your PostgreSQL database

````bash
# 1. Add the database server with your connection string
claude mcp add db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub \
--dsn "postgresql://readonly:pass@prod.db.com:5432/analytics"

# 2. Query your database naturally
> "What's our total revenue this month?"
> "Show me the schema for the orders table"
> "Find customers who haven't made a purchase in 90 days"
``` */}

### Example: Monitor errors with Sentry

```bash
# 1. Add the Sentry MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# 2. Use /mcp to authenticate with your Sentry account
> /mcp

# 3. Debug production issues
> "What are the most common errors in the last 24 hours?"
> "Show me the stack trace for error ID abc123"
> "Which deployment introduced these new errors?"
````

{/\* ### Example: Automate browser testing with Playwright

````bash
# 1. Add the Playwright MCP server
claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest

# 2. Write and run browser tests
> "Test if the login flow works with test@example.com"
> "Take a screenshot of the checkout page on mobile"
> "Verify that the search feature returns results"
``` */}

## Authenticate with remote MCP servers

Many cloud-based MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 for secure connections.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add the server that requires authentication">
  For example:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Use the /mcp command within Claude Code">
  In Claude code, use the command:

  ```
  > /mcp
  ```

  Then follow the steps in your browser to login.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Tips:

* Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
* Use "Clear authentication" in the `/mcp` menu to revoke access
* If your browser doesn't open automatically, copy the provided URL
* OAuth authentication works with both SSE and HTTP transports
</Tip>

## Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

If you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it directly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add an MCP server from JSON">
  ```bash
  # Basic syntax
  claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

  # Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
  claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the server was added">
  ```bash
  claude mcp get weather-api
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Tips:

* Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
* The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
* You can use `--scope global` to add the server to your global configuration instead of the project-specific one
</Tip>

## Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop

If you've already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop, you can import them:

<Steps>
<Step title="Import servers from Claude Desktop">
  ```bash
  # Basic syntax
  claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Select which servers to import">
  After running the command, you'll see an interactive dialog that allows you to select which servers you want to import.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the servers were imported">
  ```bash
  claude mcp list
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Tips:

* This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
* Use the `--scope global` flag to add servers to your global configuration
* Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
* If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (e.g., `server_1`)
</Tip>

## Use Claude Code as an MCP server

You can use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to:

```bash
# Start Claude as a stdio MCP server
claude mcp serve
````

You can use this in Claude Desktop by adding this configuration to claude_desktop_config.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code": {
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- The server provides access to Claude's tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
- In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
- Note that this MCP server is simply exposing Claude Code's tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.
  </Tip>

## Use MCP resources

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

### Reference MCP resources

<Steps>
  <Step title="List available resources">
    Type `@` in your prompt to see available resources from all connected MCP servers. Resources appear alongside files in the autocomplete menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a specific resource">
    Use the format `@server:protocol://resource/path` to reference a resource:

    ```
    > Can you analyze @github:issue://123 and suggest a fix?
    ```

    ```
    > Please review the API documentation at @docs:file://api/authentication
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Multiple resource references">
    You can reference multiple resources in a single prompt:

    ```
    > Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
- Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
- Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
- Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)
  </Tip>

## Use MCP prompts as slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts that become available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### Execute MCP prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover available prompts">
    Type `/` to see all available commands, including those from MCP servers. MCP prompts appear with the format `/mcp__servername__promptname`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt without arguments">
    ```
    > /mcp__github__list_prs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt with arguments">
    Many prompts accept arguments. Pass them space-separated after the command:

    ```
    > /mcp__github__pr_review 456
    ```

    ```
    > /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug in login flow" high
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- MCP prompts are dynamically discovered from connected servers
- Arguments are parsed based on the prompt's defined parameters
- Prompt results are injected directly into the conversation
- Server and prompt names are normalized (spaces become underscores)
  </Tip>

# Troubleshooting

> Discover solutions to common issues with Claude Code installation and usage.

## Common installation issues

### Windows installation issues: errors in WSL

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:

**OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

- Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
- Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

**Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Linux and Mac installation issues: permission or command not found errors

When installing Claude Code with npm, `PATH` problems may prevent access to `claude`.
You may also encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (eg. `/usr`, or `/usr/local`).

#### Recommended solution: Native Claude Code installation

Claude Code has a native installation that doesn't depend on npm or Node.js.

<Note>
  The native Claude Code installer is currently in beta.
</Note>

Use the following command to run the native installer.

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash
# Install stable version (default)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Install latest version
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s latest

# Install specific version number
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s 1.0.58
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Install stable version (default)
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

# Install latest version
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) latest

# Install specific version number
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) 1.0.58

```

This command installs the appropriate build of Claude Code for your operating system and architecture and adds a symlink to the installation at `~/.local/bin/claude`.

<Tip>
  Make sure that you have the installation directory in your system PATH.
</Tip>

#### Alternative solution: Migrate to local installation

Alternatively, if Claude Code will run, you can migrate to a local installation:

```bash
claude migrate-installer
```

This moves Claude Code to `~/.claude/local/` and sets up an alias in your shell configuration. No `sudo` is required for future updates.

After migration, restart your shell, and then verify your installation:

On macOS/Linux/WSL:

```bash
which claude  # Should show an alias to ~/.claude/local/claude
```

On Windows:

```powershell
where claude  # Should show path to claude executable
```

Verify installation:

```bash
claude doctor # Check installation health
```

## Permissions and authentication

### Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the `/permissions` command. See [Permissions docs](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#configuring-permissions).

### Authentication issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems:

1. Run `/logout` to sign out completely
2. Close Claude Code
3. Restart with `claude` and complete the authentication process again

If problems persist, try:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json
claude
```

This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.

## Performance and stability

### High CPU or memory usage

Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file

### Command hangs or freezes

If Claude Code seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart

### ESC key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals

If you're using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the ESC key doesn't interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains' default shortcuts.

To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Click the "Configure terminal keybindings" hyperlink next to "Override IDE Shortcuts"
3. Within the terminal keybindings, scroll down to "Switch focus to Editor" and delete that shortcut

This will allow the ESC key to properly function for canceling Claude Code operations instead of being captured by PyCharm's "Switch focus to Editor" action.

## Getting more help
